## Web Solar System
This program uses JavaScript and shaders to create an interactive 3D model of an orbiting solar system. The user can explore the system using mouse zoom, mouse clicks, and the WASD keys for movement. Each planet orbits at different speeds and angles, with their own rotational movement around their axes. The Sun is illuminated using Phong lighting shaders, enhancing the realism of surface reflection and light output. The Earth features a moon and a dynamic day-night cycle, adding further detail to the simulation. Notably, this program uses rasterization for rendering rather than ray tracing.
