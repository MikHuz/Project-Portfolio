# 🚪 Garage Door Customizer Web App

## 🧭 Overview

The **Garage Door Customizer** is a **responsive, single-page React web application** that enables users to browse, customize, and request quotes for garage doors.  

The app guides users through a structured workflow:  
1. **Category Carousel:** Browse door categories via an interactive image carousel.  
2. **Door Type Selection:** Explore specific door models within each category using dynamic carousels.  
3. **Dynamic Build Section:** Configure a selected door with options that dynamically update based on prior selections, reflecting accurate pricing and available features.  

The app leverages **React state management**, **routing**, and **dynamic API calls** to handle all possible door option combinations efficiently. Images are dynamically loaded and scaled based on viewport dimensions for optimal performance.  

Rather than relying on a backend database, the app uses a **CSV dataset** containing all door combinations and prices. This enables:  
- Dynamic availability of options depending on prior selections  
- Real-time pricing calculations  
- URL-based preselection for shareable configurations  

Local storage ensures user selections persist across sessions, and URL parameters allow users to share or return to specific door configurations.

> **Note:** This project was developed as a volunteer contribution for **Reliable Garage Door** and demonstrates scalable, dynamic frontend engineering.
