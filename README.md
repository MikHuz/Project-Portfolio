## Hi, I'm Michael ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a recent Computer Science graduate from California State University, Monterey Bay, with a strong foundation in **software engineering, problem-solving, and full-stack development**. I enjoy optimizing workflows, refining solutions, and leveraging **AI-assisted tools** to boost productivity and enhance output.

Iâ€™m skilled in designing, building, and integrating both front-end and back-end systems, creating efficient, scalable, and user-focused applications that bridge technical precision with real-world functionality. I enjoy exploring new technologies, tackling complex problems, and delivering high-quality solutions that make a tangible impact.

Recently, I earned the **Meta Front-End Developer Certificate** and developed a React-based web application for a local business to improve user experience. Iâ€™m expanding my expertise into cloud computing and cybersecurity, as I believe these areas are critical for the future of technology and for developing a broader perspective as an IT professional. Iâ€™m currently pursuing a cloud certification to deepen my understanding of cloud infrastructure, broadening my technical skill set beyond traditional development.

Iâ€™m eager to contribute meaningfully, collaborate effectively, and apply my knowledge to real-world challenges in IT and software engineering. This repository compiles work from my studies, projects, and personal development, showcasing practical skills and diverse technical solutions.
