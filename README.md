## Hi, I'm Michael Huziy! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a recent Computer Science graduate from California State University, Monterey Bay, with a strong foundation in software engineering and a passion for continuous learning. Over the past months, Iâ€™ve earned the **Meta Front-End Developer Certificate** and built a **React-based web application** for a local business as a volunteer project, applying modern web technologies to real-world needs.  

Iâ€™m eager to grow in the **IT and software engineering field**, open to opportunities in areas such as **front-end and back-end development, cloud technologies, and cybersecurity**. My current focus is expanding beyond front-end development into **cloud certifications and security fundamentals**, as I believe they are key to the future of tech.  

This repository highlights projects from my studies, certifications, and personal work. I'm excited to continue developing practical skills, tackling technical challenges, and applying my knowledge across diverse domains. ðŸš€
