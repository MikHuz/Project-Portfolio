## Hi, I'm Michael Huziy ðŸ‘‹

I'm a recent Computer Science graduate from California State University, Monterey Bay, with a strong foundation in software engineering and a dedication for continuous learning. Recently, I earned the **Meta Front-End Developer Certificate** and built a **React-based web application** for a local business as a volunteer project, applying modern web technologies to real-world needs.  

Iâ€™m eager to grow in the **IT and software engineering field**, with interests spanning **front-end and back-end development, cloud technologies, and data-driven solutions**. My current focus is expanding beyond software development into **cloud computing and cybersecurity**, as I believe these areas are vital to the future of technology and critical infrastructure. I value continual growth and staying informed so I can deliver high-quality, effective solutions.  

This repository compiles some of the work from my studies, projects and personal work I have developed over my time. I'm excited to continue developing practical skills, tackling technical challenges, and applying my knowledge across diverse domains!
