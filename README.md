# Hi, I'm Michael ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a recent Computer Science graduate from California State University, Monterey Bay, with a strong foundation in software engineering and problem-solving. I enjoy optimizing workflows, refining solutions to the ladt detail, and leveraging AI-assisted development tools to boost productivity and quality.

Iâ€™m eager to grow in the IT and software engineering field, with interests spanning front-end and back-end development, cloud technologies, and data-driven solutions. Recently, I earned the Meta Front-End Developer Certificate and developed a React-based web application for a local business, applying modern web technologies to real-world needs.

My current focus is expanding beyond software development into cloud computing and cybersecurity, as I believe these areas are vital to the future of technology and critical infrastructure. Iâ€™m also pursuing a cloud certification to strengthen my understanding of cloud infrastructure, deployment, and scalability, while continuing to broaden my technical skill set beyond traditional development.

This repository compiles work from my studies, projects, and personal development over time. Iâ€™m excited to continue building practical skills, tackling technical challenges, and applying my knowledge across diverse domains!
