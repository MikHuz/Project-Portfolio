## üåê Web Ray Tracer

This project is a **browser-based ray tracer** that simulates a moving light source orbiting a reflective sphere within a colored environment.  

A **ray tracer** is a rendering technique that simulates how light rays interact with surfaces ‚Äî tracing the path of each ray as it bounces, reflects, and absorbs ‚Äî to produce realistic lighting and shading effects.  

It demonstrates **real-time light reflection, shading, and color blending** using these ray tracing principles, all rendered directly in the browser for visualization.
